When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to share your code for review, or when mutiple people are working on the project.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A clone is a repository you take from Git and "clone it", or copy it, to your local computer.  A fork is a repository which you "make a copy of" for yourself, that get's stored on Git, so that you can use to modify.  A branch is the set of files (from a repository) which you're working on at the moment, whether it's from a repository on git, or on a repository on your local computer.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

A benefit is that you have the latest changes of the remote accessible even if your offline.  Thus you could refer to them, and used them, even if your in a location where you can't get online to access the remote.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

To collaborate without Git or GitHub, the collaborators would have to manually exchange files, either via email, dropbox, etc., and manually ask one another to review and/or make changes, then update the files, and again manually exchange files.  Not an efficient process.
It would be much easier to use Git and GitHub.
