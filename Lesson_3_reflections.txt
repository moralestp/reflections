When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to share your code for review, or when mutiple people are working on the project.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A clone is a repository you take from Git and "clone it", or copy it, to your local computer.  A fork is a repository which you "make a copy of" for yourself, that get's stored on Git, so that you can use to modify.  A branch is the set of files (from a repository) which you're working on at the moment, whether it's from a repository on git, or on a repository on your local computer.
