What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git directory is created. It is used to track all changes

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is an intermediate step that allows you to specify which files one will be wanting to commit, before actually performing the commit.  The value is that one can specify specific files one would like to commit without having to commit everything in the directory such as "scratch" files.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Only add the file(s), where the logical change was made, to the staging area.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Branches are helpful if one wants to try an experimental feature.  A new branch could be created to demonstrate the feature, but if the feature is not used, development can continue on the main branch.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

The diagram helps one to visualize all the branches in the structure, and which commits form part of each branch.
